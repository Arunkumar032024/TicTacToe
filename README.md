# Tic Tac Toe Game
<br>
For a Tic Tac Toe game app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, start with HTML to create a grid layout representing the game board. Utilize CSS for styling, designing the grid cells, and adding visual effects for hover and click states. In JavaScript, implement logic to handle player moves, check for winning conditions, update the game state, and determine the winner. Ensure interactivity by allowing players to click on cells to make their moves. Incorporate reset functionality for replayability. Add responsive design to accommodate different devices. With these components, you'll have a fully functional and visually appealing Tic Tac Toe game app!
